Problem Statement
==================

Let's look at Python's input reading method.

name = raw_input("Hey what's your name?\n") <br \>
Hey what's your name? <br \>
R2D2 <br \>
print name <br \>
R2D2 <br \>
That's one way of doing it for yourself. But in competitive programming we don't ask questions. We only answer them. So we will only use raw_input() to read a string without asking any question to the system.

###Task 
Read a string from the console and print it.

###Input Format 
The first and only line of input contains a string.

###Constraints 
String length ≤ 500

###Output Format 
Print the same string back.

###Sample Input

How many chickens does it take to cross the road?
###Sample Output

How many chickens does it take to cross the road?
